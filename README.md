There once was a wise man who said: "Is this a pigeon?". He was referring to a butterfly. This caused the most thought-provoking thought experiment in the world of thought experiments that you thought you knew, but alas, who would've thought you didn't thought you knew. ("didn't thought" is not grammatically correct, I know; it was for the funnies). This thought experiment is called: "i s   h u m a n i t y   d o n e   f o r". Because if this is our definition of 'wise' then I don't even know the definition of "kill me". After all, us humans are the only ones that need to pay to live. But can you live in the forest? Well, yes but actually no. Living in the forest is technically illegal, so you'd be fined for being too poor to afford a place to live, which is why taxes are a thing. Not having a dwelling and choosing to live in the forest doesn't mean that you can't pay money, unfortunately.
